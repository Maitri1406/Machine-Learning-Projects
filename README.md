# Machine-Learning-Projects
Here I built 2 project using Linear Regression and KNN in ML .This project contains two separate machine learning workflows built using Python.
The first dataset is used to build a Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction, and the second dataset is used to build a  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Model.
Both models include full data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and model evaluation.

# Project Overview
# Linear Regression Model – House Price Prediction
- Dataset: <a href="https://github.com/Maitri1406/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/House%20Price%20Forecasting%20with%20Regression%20Models.csv">Housing Price Dataset</a>
- Goal: Predict house prices based on numerical and categorical features
  - Workflow includes:
    - Handling missing values
    - Removing outliers
    - Feature engineering (rooms, land size, year built, latitude/longitude etc.)
    - One-hot encoding for categorical variables  
    - Train-test splitting
    - Linear Regression model training
    - Model evaluation using
    - R² Score
    - MAE
    - RMSE

# KNN Classification Model
- Dataset: <a href="https://github.com/Maitri1406/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Loan%20Application.xlsx">Loan Dataset</a>
- Goal: Predict class labels using similarity-based classification
  - Workflow includes:
    - Data cleaning & preprocessing
    - Encoding categorical data  
    - Feature scaling
    - Train-test splitting  
    - Model training using KNN
    - Hyperparameter tuning (finding optimal K)
    - Accuracy, confusion matrix & classification report

# Technologies Used
